# Northcoders Final Project : Love Birds

## Background

_Love Birds_ is a fun and interactive way to bring long-distance relationships together.

This application was the result of the final project phase for the [Northcoders FullStack Bootcamp](https://northcoders.com/our-courses/coding-bootcamp). The project is a React Native app written in _TypeScript_, with _Tailwind_ as a styling tool and _Google Firebase_
The purpose of the app is to establish an online relationship with your partner (or friend) and be able to send messages and pictures to them in the form of eggs. To view those messages, your connection should play some fun games to ‘hatch’ those eggs.

This project has been part of the Northcoders bootcamp, 27th March 2023 - 23rd June 2023

### 2. Install dependencies

To run the app locally, you will need Node.

```
$ npm install
```

For this project, we have used the following core dependencies:

> _React Native: v0.71.8_

> _Expo: v48.0.18_

> _Tailwindcss: v.3.3.2_

> _Firebase v9.22.2._

Also, it is important to check the `package.json` file, and see whether you have other dependencies installed.

### 3. Run dev app locally

As we are using `React Native Expo` to run the app locally, we can use `Expo Go` in Android (already provided in iOS) or run a emulation on your PC.

```
npx expo start
```

or

```
npx expo start --tunnel
```

After doing that, in your console a similar message should display:

```
Starting Metro Bundler
Tunnel connected.
Tunnel ready.
